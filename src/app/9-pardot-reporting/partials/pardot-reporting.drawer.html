        <h2>Pardot Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          With some help from Pardot and SalesforceÂ® Engage, your sales rep has likely persuaded Jeremy Jones to become
          a new customer. The sales process is complete &mdash; but as a marketer, you still want to look back at your
          campaigns to see what worked and what didn't. Pardot reporting can help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s take a look at two Pardot reports that will help you gauge your campaign success. We'll start with the
          Campaign Performance Overview report to see how your initial campaign is doing, then dive deeper with advanced
          email reporting. Let's get started!

        <h2>Campaign Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          The Campaign Performance Overview report gives a high level overview of your campaign's overall health in
          comparison to other campaigns. Each campaign is represented by a color bubble in the chart to the left. The graph
          can be adjusted by altering the values on the four axes.
