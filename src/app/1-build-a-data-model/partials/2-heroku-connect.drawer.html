        <h2>Integrate Customer Ideas</h2>
        <p>Your customers use a mobile app to control their thermostats, report issues, and even share ideas on how to improve the product.</p>
        <p>Because this mobile app was built on Heroku, a Salesforce product for creating customer apps and websites, it is easy to integrate that data.</p>
        <p>Letâ€™s start by mapping data between Heroku and Salesforce.</p>
        <p class="continue">
          <a class="btn btn-continue" href="" wz-next>Next </a>
        </p>

      <wz-step>
          <h2>Note</h2>
          <p>You are now in Heroku. The list you see here is the data that make up your mobile app.</p>
          <p>Using bi-directional synchronization, Heroku Connect unifies the data in your Heroku mobile app with your Salesforce database - contacts, accounts and other custom objects, such as the Customer Insights object we just created. All with simple clicks.</p>
