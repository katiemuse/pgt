      <p>
        In Salesforce, we think about database tables as objects, we think about columns as fields, and rows as records. So instead
        of an account spreadsheet or table, we have an Account object with fields and a bunch of identically structured records.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Standard objects</strong> are objects that are included with Salesforce. Common business objects like Account, Contact,
        Lead, and Opportunity are all standard objects.

        <strong>Custom objects</strong> are objects that you create to store information that’s specific to your company or industry.

        When you create a custom object, you can use it throughout your Salesforce instance, not just the app or database you created
        it for.
