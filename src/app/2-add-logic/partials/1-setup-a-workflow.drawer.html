    <h2>Setup a Workflow</h2>
    <p>The Process Builder tool allows you to easily automate business processes using a convenient graphical representation of your process as you build it. Automated processes in the Process Builder consist of:
      <br>
      Criteria that determine when to execute action groups and immediate and scheduled actions to execute when those criteria are met.</p>
    <p>Any change that causes a record to match the criteria automatically triggers the action group.(Describe why this will be helpful for the app weâ€™re creating-move to hot spot closer to interaction)</p>
    <p>We're going to use this tool to create a notification workflow so our Product Managers are alerted when new customer suggestions are submitted.</p>
