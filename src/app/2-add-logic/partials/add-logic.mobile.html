      <h1>Build a Mobile App for Product Managers</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Now that you have your data all ready, we are ready to build our mobile app!</p>
      <br>
      <p>We will use Lightning App Builder, Salesforce Platform's drag and drop development environment to create our app with clicks.</p>

      <p>We call them 'pages' in Lightning, but these pages are just as powerful as any app, and your users can access them through Salesforce1 or Salesforce Lightning.</p>

      <h1>Use Lightning Components to Create an App</h1>
      <p>Lightning Components is a modern UI framework that powers Lightning App Builder. With a simple drag-and-drop, you can build responsive mobile, web, and desktop applications. </p>
      <p>There are 3 types of Lightning Components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard (out of the box)</li>
        <li>Custom (build your own)</li>
        <li>AppExchange (built by partners)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll use all 3 to build Egg's Product Manager app.</p>

      <h3>Standard Components List</h3>
      <p>Standard (or Base) components provide commonly used building blocks for your app. No code required.</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>The App Builder allows you to connect Sales, Service, and other teams by pooling data from all of your objects, like Customer Service Cases and Annual Sales Orders.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row did-you-know-2">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <br><br>
      <p>We'll bring together all the components you need on the App Builder’s canvas—no code required. You can configure the components’ data with simple clicks.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>Remember the objects we mapped from Heroku and SAP? We'll add them to our app right now.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>For the Product Manager app, we'll add a Filter List housing Customer Insights detail, and a few Report Charts with Sales Orders from SAP and Customer Service Case data.</p>
