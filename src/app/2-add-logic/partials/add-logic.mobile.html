      <h1>Use Lightning Components to Create an App</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Lightning Components is a modern UI framework that powers Lightning App Builder. With a simple drag-and-drop, you can build responsive mobile, web, and desktop applications. </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>There are 3 types of Lightning Components:</p>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard (out of the box)</li>
        <li>Custom (build your own)</li>
        <li>AppExchange (built by partners)</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <p>We'll use all 3 to build Egg's Product Manager app.</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>Pardot gives users the ability to use “progressive profiling” on forms. Progressive profiling allows you to collect more data over time by dynamically displaying form fields based on whether or not a user has already filled them out. For example, if a user has already submitted their job title, the next form they encounter can ask for their industry instead.</p>

      <p>Once you've created a form, it’s time for the fun part: creating a landing page using Pardot's WYSIWYG landing page builder. You can use landing pages in tandem with forms to “gate” marketing assets like white papers and product demos, making them essential components of your lead generation strategy.</p>
