      <h1>Add Components from AppExchange</h1>
      <p>Next let’s see how easy it is to get a component from AppExchange! Simply visit the AppExchange, search for a component and drop it into the app canvas.</p>
      <p>The Customer Ideas component will let users read and respond to feedback submitted by their customers.</p>

      <h3>Get more on the AppExchange button:</h3>
      <p>The AppExchange houses more than Salesforce apps. You can also find components, consulting partners, and developers to help you extend the power of Salesforce and run your business with apps.</p>

      <h1>Add a Custom Component</h1>
      <p>In addition to standard components that Salesforce provides and those you can download from the AppExchange, you can create custom components in the Developer Console.</p>
      <p>For this Product Management app, we'll add a custom component that houses a personal and team backlog.</p>

      <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
      <p>With A/B testing, you can alter the content of an email, deploy two versions, and then test to see which performs most successfully. You can test your subject lines, images, body copy, layout, email sender, and more.</p>

      <p>You can determine how long you want the A/B testing period to last.</p>
      <p>After a certain percentage of your emails have deployed (decided by you), Pardot will select the winning email to send to the remaining email recipients on your list.</p>

      <p>A/B testing is only half of the email testing process. You want your content to resonate, but you also want to ensure that your email makes it to the inbox and displays correctly. Pardot’s email rendering can help.</p>

      <h2>Email Rendering</h2>
      <p>The email rendering preview displays a test version of your email in all of the top email clients, browsers, and mobile devices. This allows you to pinpoint any possible rendering issues before your email ends up in the inbox.</p>
      <div class="screen-shot email-rendering"></div>
      <p>Once all of the email testing is complete, you can start sending! Pardot gives you the ability to segment your database into targeted lists that can be used to send highly personalized emails.</p>
      <p>Segment your email recipients based on job title, industry, geography, and a number of other criteria.</p>
