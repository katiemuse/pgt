        <p>Pardot gives users the ability to use &ldquo;progressive profiling&rdquo; on forms. Progressive profiling
          allows you to collect more data over time by dynamically displaying form fields based on whether or not a
          user has already filled them out. For example, if a  user has already submitted their job title, the next
          form they encounter can ask for their industry instead.</p>
