      <h1>Customize the Action Bar</h1>
      <p>You can make your app even more convenient to your users by adding quick actions in the Lightning App Builder. For the Product Manager app we've been building, we'll add a few that let us move Customer Ideas to our backlog and respond directly to our customer.</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>Actions enable users to do more in Salesforce and in Salesforce1. Think of them as shortcuts. They offer a fast way for mobile users to launch a specific workflow in Salesforce1, like creating records, logging calls, or sharing files. </p>

      <h1>Create a Lightning App from Your Page</h1>
      <p>To take it a step further create Lightning App that acts as a stand-alone utility in user's phones and Salesforce instances. Deployment is a quick, simple process, just like we experienced with our Lightning Page.</p>

      <p>And that's it! We've built a new app in Salesforce Platform. And Egg's Product team can't wait to get their hands on the Customer 360. It's about time we pass it along to the team, and see what it can do.</p>
