      <h1>Building an Email</h1>
      <p>Create professional-looking emails using Pardot’s WYSIWYG email builder.</p>

      <p>Let's say you've created a form and landing page &mdash; what happens when a user submits their information?</p>
      <p>Within minutes, your buyer will have a Pardot autoresponder email containing the exact resource they requested waiting in their inbox. These emails are triggered by form submissions so that they’ll automatically deploy — no manual sending required. Creating an email in Pardot is easy.</p>
      <p>The first step is to choose an email template. Keep in mind: Pardot comes with more than forty email templates out of the box!</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>Pardot also comes with a number of responsive email templates that will ensure your emails display correctly across all devices.</p>

      <h2>Content Editing</h2>
      <p>After choosing a template, Pardot's WYSIWYG email builder allows you to input and edit your email content.</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>While Pardot comes with a number of pre-made templates for you to choose from, you can also use custom HTML to create templates of your own.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>Even if you're confident with your email template, you still want to make sure it’s performing to the best of its ability. That’s where Pardot’s A/B testing functionality comes in.</p>

  <div class="row screen-shot-container pb">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
      <p>With A/B testing, you can alter the content of an email, deploy two versions, and then test to see which performs most successfully. You can test your subject lines, images, body copy, layout, email sender, and more.</p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>You can determine how long you want the A/B testing period to last.</p>
      <p>After a certain percentage of your emails have deployed (decided by you), Pardot will select the winning email to send to the remaining email recipients on your list.</p>

  <div class="row blue-container text-left">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>A/B testing is only half of the email testing process. You want your content to resonate, but you also want to ensure that your email makes it to the inbox and displays correctly. Pardot’s email rendering can help.</p>

      <h2>Email Rendering</h2>
      <p>The email rendering preview displays a test version of your email in all of the top email clients, browsers, and mobile devices. This allows you to pinpoint any possible rendering issues before your email ends up in the inbox.</p>
      <div class="screen-shot email-rendering"></div>
      <p>Once all of the email testing is complete, you can start sending! Pardot gives you the ability to segment your database into targeted lists that can be used to send highly personalized emails.</p>
      <p>Segment your email recipients based on job title, industry, geography, and a number of other criteria.</p>

      <p>Pardot also provides a detailed SPAM analysis of each of your emails by testing them against top SPAM filters. Get a red flag? Don’t worry, Pardot will tell you what you can do to fix it.</p>
